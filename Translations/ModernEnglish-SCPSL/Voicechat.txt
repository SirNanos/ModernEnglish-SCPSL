<color=#D2D4C1>This game uses voice chat. Using the push-to-talk buttons (by default, "Q" and "V") will capture your microphone input and transmit it to other users connected to the server.\nCertain game features may temporarily store short samples of your transmissions, which will be automatically erased after disconnecting from the server.</color>

Microphone Capture
<color=#D2D4C1>Allow the game to capture your microphone and transmit it to users when push-to-talk buttons are held. A microphone icon will be displayed at the bottom of the screen, serving as an indicator of active transmission. The game will never transmit or use your voice without the indicator being visible.
<color=#D2D4C1>Short Recordings</color>
<color=#F00>Allow game mechanics to use short recordings of your voice. This includes SCP-939's "With Many Voices" ability, which can record and play back short voice samples of players that were killed. All recordings are discarded the moment you leave the server or the round is restarted.</color>
